				My name is Julie, and I have three children. they will soon become independent of me and live a precious life. Sometimes very tired and sometimes they'll be really lonely.  I wanted to make food as comforting as long as my daughters could get along because a large part of what has sustained me for 18 years in the U.S. was my comfort foods. (which is  the food what my mother usually made it   for  me ). Korean food can also be maintained in health, body, and spirit. Not only it isn't heavy calories and rich in nutrients, but it is also rich in fermented foods, which boosts immunity and helps you have a comfortable body and mind.
				A Korean table that is easy to make and easy to make in the United States. In college dorms, I wanted to give my daughters a recipe book that they can easily make even when they live alone in the future. 
				I want to provide an easy recipe for not only my kids but also all my sons and daughters who live their life all over the world in bravely themselves.</p>
