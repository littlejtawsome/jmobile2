				My name is Julie, and I have three children. They will soon become grow independent from me and live their own precious lives. Sometimes, life away from family can be tiring and lonely. 
				During my 16 years of living in the U.S. there were plenty of difficult moments, but what helped me get along were my comfort foods, particularly recipes that my mother passed down to me. 
				I want to make food that is comforting and lifts the spirits of my daughters as it did mine. Korean food is light in calories and high in nutrients, and rich with fermented foods, which can boost immunity. Along with its health benefits, Korean food holds flavors that are bold: tangy, spicy, garlicky tones that can warm you on any day. In this way, Korean cuisine helps the body and the soul. 
				A Korean table of food can seem intimidating to cook, but itâ€™s actually quite easy to make in the U.S., even in places like college dorm kitchens. I hope that this collection of recipes is a way my daughters, along with other sons and daughters living alone, can make this generational comfort food for themselves</p>
